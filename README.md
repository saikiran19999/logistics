Logistics TMS is an ultimate solution for all transport management needs. With a focus on automation, this Transportation Management System (TMS) is designed to streamline logistics, offering an efficient, optimized way to manage inbound and outbound transport operations.

## Overview

Logistics TMS primarily targets logistics and trucking companies seeking to streamline their operations. It offers a comprehensive suite that encompasses an administrator web application, a management web application, and a driver mobile application. The backend is powered by a robust REST API and an Identity Server application.

Operating on a multi-tenant architecture, Logistics TMS features a primary database for storing user credentials and tenant data, including company name, subdomain name, database connection string, and billing periods. Each tenant or company has a dedicated database.

## Development status
The project is actively under development. I have completed nearly 85% of the work required for the inaugural release of the MVP.
